/*
These utility styles should be considered immutable. They aid in scalability,
maintenance, and readability by clearing stating what they do. For example, .u-db should
always set display: block; and nothing else. This is similar to the concept of doing
one thing and doing it well. If a particular utility class does not suite the needs of
the mark-up element itâ€™s applied to, remove/replace it from HTML.
